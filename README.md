# InsertSoundBoardHere

Hello and welcome!

Are you in need of a program that allows you to play sounds through your mic?

Do you need an escape from Discords inbuilt soundboard?

...Or maybe you just want to micspam on TF2 community servers XD

WELL, I'm not here to question what your needs are lol, instead, I'm here to introduce InsertSoundBoardHere!

InsertSoundBoardHere is a program that I've written using Python that allows users to play any sound they desire
through their microphone! :D

## Installation and Requirements
